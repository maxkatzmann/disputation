# disputation

[![Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OuHBBrLgHII/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OuHBBrLgHII "Watch the video")

This repository contains the code used to generate the slides for my
disputation and the corresponding video shown above. The main frameworks used
are [Manim](https://www.manim.community) and the hyperbolic extension
thereof, called [HManim](https://maxkatzmann.github.io/hmanim/).

## Installation

Create a virtual Python environment and install the required packages using

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Rendering

Following the installation, you can render the video file representing a slide using

``` bash
python -m manim -p slide2.py Slide2
```

_The `-p` flag is used to preview the video after rendering._

For other slides just replace the `2`s above with the corresponding slide
number. I recommend **not** starting with slide 1, since that is rather
expensive to render.
